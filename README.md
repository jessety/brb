# brb-site

> Simple web server that returns a maintenance message

Sure, it shouldn't ever happen. Failover should work just fine. The deploy should be instant. Then, somehow, the worst happens: it stalls. You need a downtime message, and fast! Just type `brb-site` and breathe easily for a moment.

`brb-site` serves a simple downtime message HTML page with client-side JavaScript to push users to your site once it's back. Every 15 seconds, the page makes a request to the server in the background. So long as it gets back a response, the page reloads. If `brb-site` is still running, nothing will change. If your site is back, this ensures they're bounced back to it as soon as possible. If the server is hard-down while your site is spinning up, the page won't reload until it's up.

## Dependency

You may also use `brb-site` as a dependency in your project.

const BRBServer = require('brb-site');

const brb = new BRBServer({ port: 8080, verbose: true });

brb.start();
// ...

```
